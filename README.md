This repo is my answer to end of chapter exercises for the book [Programming: Principles and Practice Using C++ (2nd Edition)](http://www.amazon.com/Programming-Principles-Practice-Using-Edition/dp/0321992784) written by Bjarne Stroustrup.

My intention is to leave some trace of my practices so that later on I know why I did what I did. Therefore leave a chance for futher efficiency improvement. 

Please note that my answer is just my way to do things, you certainly may have better solutions.
