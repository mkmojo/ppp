This repo is my answer to end of chapter exercises for the book [Programming: Principles and Practice Using C++ (2nd Edition)](http://www.amazon.com/Programming-Principles-Practice-Using-Edition/dp/0321992784) written by Bjarne Stroustrup.

This book is not for everyone. The goal of this book is to teach novice programmer software engineering concepts. It just happends so it uses C++ as the teaching tool.

In my opinion, this book works great for those from an EE background. 

My intention is to leave some trace of my practices so that later on I know why I did what I did. Therefore leave a chance for futher efficiency improvement. 

Please note that my answer is just my way to do things, you certainly may have better solutions. 

Also, I did not plan to have a complete answer set to all exercises. If you are interested in some particular ones, please find your own way to them. 

If you feel like a discussion, please create open issues, I would be more than happy to help out.
